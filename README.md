- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarinaMTS
- 👀 I’m interested in using data science to help build a sustainable future in energy :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about neural networks and deep learning techniques, as well as high performance computing and parallilzation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet, but maybe in the future, how AI/ML techniques can be used to improve the wind energy sector.
- 📫 You can reach me if you know me already.
